# Worktree Util Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.config/worktree-util/config.yml to customize settings

# Directory where worktrees will be created (relative to repository root)
# Default: .worktrees
# Examples:
#   worktree_dir: .worktrees        # Default - creates .worktrees/ in repo root
#   worktree_dir: worktrees          # Creates worktrees/ in repo root
#   worktree_dir: ../my-worktrees    # Creates my-worktrees/ outside repo
worktree_dir: .worktrees

# Files to copy from repository root to new worktrees
# Useful for .gitignore'd files like .env that are needed in each worktree
# Default: [] (no files copied)
# Examples:
#   copy_files:
#     - .env
#     - .env.local
#     - config/local.yml
# Note: Files that don't exist will be silently skipped
copy_files: []
